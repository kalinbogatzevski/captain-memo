# Changelog

All notable changes to captain-memo are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project adheres to
semantic-ish versioning while pre-1.0. Full notes for each release live on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/kalinbogatzevski/captain-memo/releases).

## [0.2.20] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **The worker no longer shows a console window (Windows).** The Scheduled Task launches
  `bun` with an interactive token, so the worker popped a console window on every start.
  It now launches through a hidden `wscript` + `scripts/hidden-launch.vbs` wrapper — no
  console, no admin. The wrapper WAITS on the `bun` child, so the task stays "Running" for
  the worker's lifetime (the crash-recovery / `IgnoreNew` lifecycle and the port-based
  reclaim are unchanged) and propagates the child's exit code. S4U needs elevation and
  `conhost --headless` detaches (breaking the lifecycle) — both verified dead ends here;
  the VBScript host is the only no-admin option (validated live: worker runs hidden).
  Trade-off: a few seconds of extra startup latency (the `wscript`→`bun` hop).

## [0.2.19] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **The embed-retry queue now backs off exponentially too.** Failed embeds (Voyage
  overloaded/down — timeouts, truncated responses) used to retry on a fixed 60 s tick;
  a chunk that keeps failing now waits progressively longer **per row** (~15-30 s on the
  first failure, then exponential with full jitter, capped at 10 min), so a Voyage outage
  stops being hammered while a transient blip still recovers fast. Mirrors the summarizer
  backoff from 0.2.18 (reuses `computeBackoffMs`; new `embedRetryDelayMs` helper, unit-tested).

### Fixed
- `/captain-memo:stats` now surfaces the `Worker  ● online · up …` liveness line (the CLI
  `captain-memo stats` / `top` already did since 0.2.17).

## [0.2.18] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **The summarizer backs off when the Anthropic API is overloaded or down.** Bursts
  of `HTTP 529 overloaded_error` previously made the obs-batch loop retry every 5 s,
  hammering a struggling API — and after 3 fails it would dead-letter the
  observations. Now an overloaded/unreachable failure (408 / 429 / 5xx / network /
  timeout) puts the whole obs-batch loop into an **exponential-backoff cooldown**
  (full jitter, 15 s → 10 min cap, honoring a server `Retry-After`), and the affected
  observations are **requeued without counting a retry** — so a long outage *delays*
  summarization instead of losing observations. A clean summarize clears the cooldown.
  Permanent errors (auth / bad request / missing model) still dead-letter immediately;
  genuine per-item failures (e.g. a malformed model response) still dead-letter after a
  bounded retry. New pure, unit-tested helpers (`classifySummarizeFailure`,
  `computeBackoffMs`).

## [0.2.17] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **Dropped the standalone `captain-memo-watchdog` Scheduled Task.** It probed the
  worker every 5 minutes, but the Task Scheduler launches `bun` with an interactive
  token, so it flashed a console window each tick — and there's no clean no-admin way
  to hide a task's window (S4U needs elevation; `conhost --headless` breaks the task
  lifecycle the reclaim relies on). Autonomous recovery of a dead/zombie worker now
  rides on the `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` self-heal (reclaim-then-start at
  session boundaries). `install` removes the task if an earlier version registered it;
  `worker-watchdog` survives as a manual command for an explicit probe + reclaim.

### Added
- **Worker liveness on the stats page.** `/stats` now reports the worker's boot epoch
  and uptime, and `captain-memo top` / `captain-memo stats` show a
  `Worker  ● online · up 2h 13m` line — so a silently-restarting worker is visible at
  a glance (offline still shows the prominent "WORKER UNREACHABLE — STALE" banner).

### Fixed
- **No console-window flash from background service-management calls.** The
  `Bun.spawn` invocations of PowerShell / `schtasks` (status / start / stop / reclaim,
  run by the worker, the hooks, and `install`) now pass `windowsHide: true`.

## [0.2.16] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **The watchdog no longer kills a *busy* worker.** `captain-memo-watchdog`
  reclaimed (hard-killed + restarted) the worker on a **single** missed `/health`
  probe. A healthy-but-busy worker — e.g. while the summarizer retried an overloaded
  API (HTTP 529) — could miss one 3-second probe and get killed and re-indexed every
  ~5 minutes, dropping in-flight work (and, on Windows, popping a console window each
  time). The watchdog now **confirms a real outage with spaced retries** (probes up
  to 3× / 2 s apart) and treats the worker as healthy if *any* attempt succeeds, so
  only a *persistent* outage — a true zombie — is reclaimed. Unit-tested
  (`probeHealthyWithRetries`: first-ok / recover-midway / all-fail / recover-on-last).

## [0.2.15] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Zombie-worker recovery — a worker whose HTTP server died (but the process is still
  alive) is now recovered automatically.** A worker can become a *zombie*: the process
  is up but `Bun.serve` no longer answers `/health`. On Windows this defeated every
  recovery path — a bare `Start-ScheduledTask` is a no-op under
  `MultipleInstancesPolicy=IgnoreNew` while the zombie holds the task "Running", and the
  5-minute watchdog trigger is blocked for the same reason. In the field this left the
  worker unreachable for ~2.7 h until a manual kill. The `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit`
  self-heal now *reclaims* before starting: `stop` gained a `force` option that hard-kills
  whatever `bun` process still holds the worker port (best-effort, never fatal — a reclaim
  failure can't block the restart), so the next start binds a fresh worker. systemd is
  unaffected (`systemctl stop` already kills; `force` is a documented no-op there).

### Added
- **Autonomous watchdog task (`captain-memo-watchdog`, Windows).** A *separate* per-user
  Scheduled Task runs `captain-memo worker-watchdog` every 5 minutes: it probes `/health`
  and, if the worker is unreachable, reclaims the port and restarts it — recovering a
  zombie even with no Claude session open. It must be its own task because `IgnoreNew`
  blocks the worker task's own relaunch while the zombie holds it "Running". Registered by
  `install`, removed by `uninstall`.
- **`top` / `watch` stale-data banner.** When the worker stops answering, the live
  dashboard now shows a prominent "WORKER UNREACHABLE — data is STALE" banner (with the
  last-good timestamp) instead of rendering the last snapshot behind a ticking clock as if
  it were live.

### Tests
- New unit tests: `restartWorker` (reclaim-then-start ordering; `force` always set), the
  pure `runWorkerWatchdog` policy (healthy no-op / unreachable→reclaim / lock-held→skip /
  reclaim-failure / still-down), the `buildReclaimPortCommand` PowerShell builder (exact
  `bun` guard, no `$pid` self-kill footgun, bounded loop, invalid-port rejection), and the
  `top` unreachable banner. Validated end-to-end against a live zombie on real Windows
  Task Scheduler.

## [0.2.14] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Worker auto-recovery — a killed worker now returns on its own.** systemd units
  use `Restart=always` (+ `StartLimitIntervalSec=0`, so a flapping worker is never
  permanently abandoned by systemd's start-rate limiter); the Windows Scheduled Task
  gains a 5-minute watchdog repetition trigger (`MultipleInstancesPolicy=IgnoreNew`
  makes it a no-op when the worker is alive). This closes the gap where a clean-signal
  kill (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`; Windows `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT` / `0xC000013A`) was NOT
  treated as a restartable failure, leaving the worker dead until a manual restart or
  logon. Applies to both the worker and the embedder.
- **`SessionStart` self-heal.** A dead worker is started, and a *stale* one — running
  code older than the installed `VERSION` — is graceful-restarted (bounded wait), so a
  new session always opens on a healthy, current worker. `UserPromptSubmit` nudges a
  dead worker back without blocking the prompt. The heal policy lives in a pure,
  unit-tested `ensureWorkerHealthy` orchestrator and is serialized across concurrent
  sessions by an advisory lock. Opt out with `CAPTAIN_MEMO_DISABLE_SELF_HEAL=1`.

### Tests
- New unit tests: the Windows watchdog trigger XML, the always-on systemd templates,
  the advisory heal-lock (acquire / TTL-reclaim / idempotent release), and the
  `ensureWorkerHealthy` policy (healthy / unreachable→start / stale→restart /
  lock-held→skip / start-failure→report). The SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hook
  tests were updated to exercise the self-heal gate.
- `dispatcher-e2e` and the `hook` dev script now reference `bin/captain-memo-hook.ts`
  directly (not the extensionless `bin/captain-memo-hook` symlink), so the suite is
  green on a Windows checkout where `core.symlinks=false` materializes the symlink as
  plain text.

### Notes
- **Local Dreaming** accumulates co-retrieval data only while the recall audit is on.
  It is opt-in and default-off: set `CAPTAIN_MEMO_RECALL_AUDIT=1` in `worker.env` and
  restart the worker. Privacy trade-off — audit lines contain prompt text and stay
  strictly local (`<data-dir>/recall-audit.jsonl`, never transmitted).

## [0.2.13] — 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **Hook failures are now visible instead of silently swallowed.** The v0.2.12 fix
  restored hook *dispatch*, but the handlers still discarded their `workerFetch`
  results — so a worker outage would have reproduced the same silent freeze
  (frozen stats, no banner) with an **empty `hook.log`**, undebuggable. Now every
  worker call in `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `PreCompact`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and
  `SessionStart` logs non-OK/timeout results via a new `logWorkerFailure` helper,
  and every previously-swallowed stdin-parse error is logged too. Fail-open is
  unchanged — no hook ever throws, exits non-zero, or blocks Claude Code.
- **`SessionStart` shows a degraded banner when the worker is unreachable** —
  `⚓ Captain Memo — worker unreachable / Memory is paused this session …` — instead
  of falling silent, so a missing banner can no longer be mistaken for a broken
  hook. Memory resumes automatically once the worker answers again.

### Tests
- New pure unit tests for `workerFailureMessage` (the OK→no-log path plus the
  timeout / HTTP-error / status-fallback branches), and a behavioral test that
  spawns the committed bundle against a closed worker port and asserts the
  degraded banner is emitted (not silence).

## [0.2.12] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Every Claude Code hook was a silent no-op (regression in v0.2.3–v0.2.11).** The
  committed plugin bundle (`plugin/dist/captain-memo-hook.js`) dispatched to its
  handlers via `await import(target)` with a **variable** specifier. `bun build`
  only inlines a dynamic import whose specifier is a string **literal** — a variable
  is left as a *runtime* import, which then resolved `../hooks/*.ts` next to the
  single-file bundle (where no such files ship) and threw `Cannot find module`. The
  dispatcher's fail-open `catch → exit(0)` swallowed it, so **the SessionStart stats
  banner never appeared and PostToolUse never captured observations** — yet every
  hook reported success. Fix: `src/hooks/dispatcher.ts` now **statically imports**
  all five handlers and dispatches by function reference, so `bun build` inlines
  every handler into a genuinely self-contained bundle (89 → 359 lines).
- This restores the startup banner, prompt-time memory injection, observation
  capture, the Stop drain, and the PreCompact recap — all of which had been dormant.

### Tests
- New guards so this cannot silently recur: a **behavioral** test spawns the
  committed bundle and asserts it dispatches end-to-end (the prompt echoes back), a
  **self-contained** test asserts every handler body is inlined and no `../hooks/`
  path reference survives, and a **source-rebuild** test builds the bundle fresh
  from source and re-checks the same invariants (catching committed-vs-source drift
  on every OS, not just Linux CI).

## [0.2.11] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **`install` (re-run / upgrade) no longer silently drops the user's config.** A
  re-install — notably `install --yes` — now loads the existing `worker.env` as the
  fallback (precedence: flag → env → existing → default), via a new exported
  `loadExistingConfig()` that reverse-parses `worker.env` into a `WizardConfig`.
  Previously it passed `{}`, so a headless upgrade rewrote `worker.env` from
  defaults and **silently produced a keyless, non-embedding file** (the reported
  bug). Now preserved across an upgrade:
  - the embedder **API key**, model, endpoint, and a **non-default embedding
    dimension** (was reset to 1024 → model/dimension mismatch);
  - the **summarizer provider + model** (anthropic model was reset to
    `claude-haiku-4-5`), and `summarizer=skip` (was flipped to `claude-oauth`);
  - the **watch choice** including `skip` and custom globs (was reset to
    `all-projects`), and a tuned `CAPTAIN_MEMO_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS`.
  `skip` choices are inferred from the absence of their line (the worker treats an
  unknown provider as "fall back to default", so writing a literal `=skip` would
  wrongly re-enable it — no worker change was made).
- **Embedder-provider inference no longer misclassifies a remote `:8124` endpoint**
  as the local sidecar (which dropped its endpoint/model/dim/key); only a loopback
  `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` `:8124` is treated as the sidecar.
- **`loadExistingConfig` is best-effort** — an unreadable `worker.env` warns and
  degrades to "no preserved values" instead of aborting the upgrade with a stack
  trace.

### Added
- Guard tests for every preservation case above
  (`tests/unit/install-preserve-config.test.ts`) and for the v0.2.10 doctor
  orphan-skip (`tests/unit/doctor-cache.test.ts`; `findCachedPluginRoot` is now
  exported + parameterized by cache root for testability).

### Known limitation
- A hand-edited `CAPTAIN_MEMO_DATA_DIR` is **not** preserved across re-install (it's
  a fixed/computed location, not a wizard field) — the wizard never produces a
  non-standard one, so this only affects manual edits.

## [0.2.10] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **`doctor` now respects Claude Code's plugin-cache grace period.** After an
  upgrade, Claude Code keeps the previous version's cache dir for 7 days (marked
  with `.orphaned_at`) before garbage-collecting it itself. `findCachedPluginRoot`
  now skips orphaned dirs and evaluates only the active copy, so a normal
  grace-period leftover is never mistaken for the install or reported as "stale" —
  which would have wrongly suggested a manual cache cleanup. (Researched against
  the Claude Code plugins reference: there is no sanctioned command to prune stale
  versions and reaching into the cache is unsupported, so the correct behavior is
  to leave the cache to Claude Code and just read it correctly.)

## [0.2.9] — 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **One version, everywhere.** The version is now sourced from a single global
  (`src/shared/version.ts`, re-exporting `package.json`'s version) consumed by the
  CLI banner, the worker `/stats` response, and the MCP `serverInfo`. The MCP
  server had a stray hardcoded `'0.1.0-alpha'`; the CLI and worker each imported
  `package.json` independently. Now there is exactly one place to read from — and
  exactly one place to bump.
- **`package.json`, `plugin.json`, and `marketplace.json` versions are unified**
  (all → 0.2.9) and a guard test asserts they stay identical. Because the
  plugin-cache key is the manifest version, bumping all three every release makes
  the cache key advance each time — so the frozen-cache class of bug (v0.2.8)
  cannot recur, with the `marketplace remove`→`add` refresh as belt-and-suspenders.

### Fixed (review hardening)
- **`install` no longer risks destroying a corrupt `settings.json`.** `readSettings`
  treated a present-but-unparseable file as empty and then wrote a near-empty file
  back over it — a stray trailing comma mid-edit could have wiped a user's hooks /
  model / statusLine on upgrade. It now refuses to modify a file it can't parse and
  surfaces a fix-it message.
- **The plugin-cache refresh `marketplace remove` is now `--scope user`,** so it
  can't silently migrate a deliberately project/local-scoped marketplace to user
  scope. The remove→add order is extracted into a pure, exported
  `pluginRegistrationSteps()` and unit-tested (the v0.2.8 fix was previously
  untested). Added guards for committed-bundle version freshness (catches a
  bump-without-rebuild) and `--no-grant-permissions` parsing.

### Note
- The worker reports its version as of process **start** (it reads the source once
  and Bun doesn't hot-reload), so after upgrading, restart the worker
  (`systemctl --user restart captain-memo-worker`, or `captain-memo install`) for
  `/stats` to show the new number.

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **`install`/upgrade now repairs a frozen plugin cache.** A `directory`-source
  marketplace is snapshotted by Claude Code at *add* time, and a bare
  `claude plugin marketplace add` is a no-op once the entry exists — so a plugin
  file that changed after the marketplace was first added (notably `hooks.json`)
  stayed **frozen** in the cache. After the v0.2.3 `bin/`→`dist/` hook move, any
  install whose marketplace had been added at 0.1.0 kept launching the deleted
  `bin/captain-memo-hook`, producing `… /plugin/bin/captain-memo-hook: not found`
  on every hook event. `registerPlugin` now does a best-effort
  `marketplace remove` before `add`, forcing a fresh re-copy of the current plugin
  on **every** install/upgrade.

### Changed
- **`marketplace.json` plugin version synced to `plugin.json` (→ 0.2.4).** It had
  silently lagged at 0.1.0, which is what froze the directory-marketplace cache.

### Added
- **Guard tests (`tests/unit/plugin-manifest.test.ts`).** Assert `marketplace.json`
  and `plugin.json` versions stay in lockstep, and that the shipped hooks reference
  the committed `dist/` bundle (never the deleted `bin/captain-memo-hook` symlink)
  with both bundles present — turning this class of drift into a CI failure rather
  than a field break.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **`install` now allowlists captain-memo's own MCP tools.** A plugin can't
  self-grant permissions via `claude plugin install` (by design), so in
  restrictive modes like "don't ask" the agent's calls to the plugin's tools
  (`stats`, `search_*`, `get_full`, …) were auto-denied. `captain-memo install`
  now adds `mcp__plugin_captain-memo_captain-memo__*` to the user's
  `~/.claude/settings.json` `permissions.allow` — idempotent and non-destructive
  (existing entries and other settings are preserved) — so the plugin's tools
  work without a per-call prompt. Opt out with `--no-grant-permissions`.
  (Installer/CLI-side only — the plugin bundle is unchanged from v0.2.4.)

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-30

### Internal / Docs
- `doctor`'s `plugin entry (cache)` check now reports the **active (highest-version)**
  cache dir instead of whichever the filesystem listed first — it could name a
  stale `0.1.0` dir while a newer version was installed. Cosmetic: the check
  already passed; it just named the wrong directory.
- README: documented updating (`claude plugin update captain-memo@captain-memo`,
  fully-qualified id) and that a **local-directory** marketplace needs a
  `marketplace remove` + `add` refresh after a version bump (a GitHub marketplace
  re-fetches automatically).

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed (Windows)
- **The no-admin worker install now actually completes.** v0.2.4 added the
  required `<UserId>` to the task XML (correct), but also flipped the XML to
  `encoding="UTF-8"` — and `schtasks /Create /XML` **requires UTF-16 LE + BOM**
  (UTF-8 is rejected: *"unable to switch the encoding"*). The task XML is again
  declared `UTF-16` and written UTF-16 LE + BOM (`toTaskXmlBuffer`), so a normal
  user's `captain-memo install` registers the worker task with no elevation.
  (The plugin bundle is unchanged from v0.2.4 — this is installer-side only.)

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed (Windows)
- **The worker Scheduled Task now installs without admin.** v0.2.3 switched to
  `schtasks /Create /XML`, but the generated task XML omitted `<UserId>`, so
  `schtasks` couldn't scope the task to the current user and demanded an elevated
  token (`Access is denied` for a normal user). The `<Principal>` **and**
  `<LogonTrigger>` now carry the current user's `<UserId>`, and the XML
  declaration is `UTF-8` to match the bytes written to disk.
- **Per-release plugin version.** `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` was pinned
  at `0.1.0`, so the plugin **cache key never changed between releases** and
  `claude plugin update` could reuse a stale (broken) cached copy. It now tracks
  the release version, so an update actually delivers the new bundle.

### Docs
- README marketplace example uses the unambiguous `owner/repo` form.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed (Windows — from a native field-install report)
- **The plugin is now self-contained — no more git symlinks.** `plugin/src` and
  `plugin/bin` were committed as symlinks (`→ ../src`, `→ ../bin`); on a Windows
  checkout (`core.symlinks=false`) they materialized as 6-byte text files, got
  copied into the plugin cache, and the configured entry paths didn't resolve —
  so the **MCP server never started and all 5 hooks were silent no-ops** (and
  `doctor` stayed green). The HTTP-only entrypoints are now bundled into
  `plugin/dist/{mcp-server,captain-memo-hook}.js` (via `bun run build:plugin`),
  the manifests point there, and the symlinks are gone. Works on a fresh Windows
  install with no junction workarounds.
- **Worker Scheduled Task installs without admin.** Replaced the
  `Register-ScheduledTask` call (which needs elevation on Windows 11) with
  `schtasks /Create /XML` (per-user, `InteractiveToken` / `LeastPrivilege`,
  logon trigger, restart-on-failure) — no UAC, matching the installer's promise.

### Added
- **Non-interactive install.** `captain-memo install` accepts flags (`--embedder`,
  `--voyage-key`, `--summarizer`, `--watch`, `-y/--yes`, …) and `CAPTAIN_MEMO_*`
  env fallbacks, so it works over a non-TTY stdin (headless / remote / Windows).

### Internal
- `doctor` now validates the plugin **entry bundles** resolve (FAIL if the
  manifests point at missing/placeholder files) and WARNs on a stale cache copy.
- CI rebuilds `plugin/dist` and fails on drift, so the committed bundles can't
  go stale vs. their source.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-30

### Internal
- **Deterministic CI on ubuntu + windows.** No runtime change from v0.2.1 — this
  is test-infrastructure hardening so the green check is trustworthy:
  - All worker-starting tests now bind **OS-assigned ephemeral ports** (`port: 0`,
    reading the actual port back from the handle) instead of hardcoded ports,
    eliminating intermittent `EADDRINUSE` collisions under CI timing / TIME_WAIT.
  - The I/O-bound `VACUUM` tests get a Windows-safe 30 s timeout (SQLite `VACUUM`
    rewrites the whole file and the windows-latest disk is slow).
  - Hermetic git identity in the branch tests; `os.tmpdir()` instead of a
    hardcoded `/tmp` SQLite path; resolved a pre-existing `Observation`-type
    `tsc` error.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **Windows: memory/skill frontmatter is now parsed regardless of line endings.**
  The memory-file and skill chunkers used an LF-only frontmatter parser, so `.md`
  files with CRLF line endings (common on Windows, or an autocrlf git checkout)
  silently lost their frontmatter — its fields (`type`/`name`/`description`) were
  dropped from the index and the `---` delimiters leaked into chunk text. Content
  is now normalized CRLF→LF before parsing.

### Internal
- CI now runs the full suite on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` (green
  on both). Fixed test portability the first real Windows run exposed: hermetic
  git identity in the branch tests, `os.tmpdir()` instead of a hardcoded `/tmp`
  SQLite path, deduplicated worker ports, and a pre-existing `Observation`-type
  typecheck error.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Native Windows support (x64).** Captain Memo now installs and runs on
  Windows without WSL. The runtime was already portable (Bun, `bun:sqlite` +
  `sqlite-vec`, all CLI↔worker↔embedder IPC over localhost HTTP); this release
  ports the operational layer — install / supervise / uninstall / upgrade /
  doctor — off its systemd + POSIX-shell assumptions.
- **Per-user Scheduled Task supervision.** A new OS-agnostic `ServiceManager`
  interface backs daemon supervision: `systemd` (`systemctl --user`) on Linux,
  a per-user **Scheduled Task** (PowerShell `Register-ScheduledTask`, registered
  at logon with restart-on-failure, no admin/UAC) on Windows. The five lifecycle
  commands call only this interface, never the OS directly.
- **In-process `worker.env` loader (`loadWorkerEnv`).** Replaces the systemd
  `EnvironmentFile=` mechanism that has no Windows equivalent. Runs at the top of
  the worker / MCP / CLI bootstrap on every platform, parsing `KEY=VALUE` lines
  from `CONFIG_DIR/worker.env` (plus `/etc/captain-memo/worker.env` on Linux) and
  seeding `process.env` **without overwriting** vars already set — so a shell
  `export` or systemd `EnvironmentFile` still wins.
- **Optional local Python embedder on Windows.** The `local-sidecar` backend is
  now installable on Windows via a PowerShell port (`install-embedder.ps1`),
  behind a new `EmbedderInstaller` interface (bash on Linux, PowerShell on
  Windows). Hosted Voyage remains the default and needs no installer at all.
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` override** for the `claude-oauth` summarizer — a
  guaranteed escape hatch when the token lives in the OS keychain / Credential
  Manager rather than `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on `ubuntu-latest` + `windows-latest`:
  `bun install`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, plus a Windows-only smoke test
  that loads the native `sqlite-vec` `vec0.dll` (`Database` + `sqliteVec.load`).

### Changed
- **Hosted Voyage is the default embedder** on Windows — no Python to
  misconfigure for the recommended path.
- Hook commands in `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` are now interpreter-explicit
  (`bun "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/captain-memo-hook.ts" <Event>`), dropping the
  `"shell": "bash"` pin and the shebang/extension dependence — identical on
  Linux and Windows. `bin/captain-memo-hook` is renamed to
  `bin/captain-memo-hook.ts` (content unchanged).
- `project_id` resolution now splits the cwd on `[\\/]`, so a Windows
  `C:\Users\…` path keys to the folder name rather than the whole path.

### Fixed
- **Linux behavior is unchanged.** The `systemd` `ServiceManager` reproduces the
  prior `systemctl --user` behavior; `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` stay green
  and `install` / `doctor` / `uninstall` behave exactly as before.

### Notes
- `win32-arm64` is **unsupported**; run x64 Bun (under emulation on arm64).
  `bun install` must run on the Windows x64 target so `sqlite-vec`'s `vec0.dll`
  is present (a Linux-built `node_modules` lacks it).
- **WSL2 remains a fully supported fallback** — run the unchanged Linux installer
  inside the distro and run Claude Code inside WSL too.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`captain-memo top`** — an interactive, htop-style live stats TUI. Four modes
  (dashboard ⇄ table ⇄ detail ⇄ help) with sort, type-filter, free-text find,
  near-duplicate collapse, and drill-in. Opening an observation counts as a
  drill, so the tool is self-measuring. Press `?` in-app for the full key map
  and a glossary. A live date/time clock sits top-right and ticks each refresh.
- **`captain-memo dedup`** — fold near-duplicate observations together. Dry-run
  by default; `--apply` archives members into the survivor (counts summed,
  `observations.db` backed up first); `--undo` reverses it; `--threshold N`
  tunes aggressiveness. Fully reversible (archival, not deletion).
- **"Last surfaced" pulse + "Recently surfaced" list** in `stats`, with per-source
  provenance (auto/search/drill).
- **Near-duplicate collapse** in the Top lists (`(+N similar)`), summing counts —
  one token-set-Jaccard similarity primitive shared by `stats`, `top`, and `dedup`.
- HTTP endpoints `/recall/list` (server-side sort/filter/page/collapse) and
  `/observation/full` (drill-in that bumps `from_drill`).

### Changed
- **`captain-memo watch` is deprecated** — it now forwards to `top` (and the
  external `procps`/`watch` dependency is gone).
- Schema **migration v7** adds `last_surfaced_source`, recording which path drove
  each observation's most recent surfacing.
- Archived observations are now excluded from `stats` **and** the live search
  path (reversible post-filter — no vector mutation).

### Fixed
- Hardened via a multi-agent review pass: collapse `total` reports the
  pre-collapse match count (not the group count); deterministic id tie-break in
  collapse ordering; `mergeDuplicateGroup` preserves a NULL `last_surfaced_at`
  instead of coercing it to epoch 0; `dedup --undo` tolerates corrupted
  `theme_member_ids`; `top` sanitizes worker error text against ANSI injection
  and discards stale concurrent fetches via a state-snapshot guard.
